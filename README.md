## Data

Though the data comes from Data VIC, they don't provide the coordinates to exposure sites.

[Please find the repo where](https://github.com/markbattistella/exposure-vic-api) I parse the sites and geocode them with PositionStack.

It's not 100% perfect, so there are some manual fixes done, but if you want to help, it would be appreciated!
